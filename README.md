Formula Helper

This App is based on one universal function, which accepts as parameter formula Object. It returns as many input fields as the current formula Object specifies.
After you submit the button It invokes special method on formula Object, which returns process of calculation and final result.

I create It using HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript.

To add another formula to this App do this:
- go to ObjectFunctions.js and add to the end of functionsContainer new Object which must contain name, type, inputs and method
- go to functions.js and write your function to calculate this formula, which you passed as method to your Object
